## Usage

### Add this marketplace locally

```bash
/plugin marketplace add /path/to/claude-skills
```

### Update the marketplace

```bash
/plugin marketplace update alberto-skills
```

### Install skills

1. Select `/plugin` and then `Browse and install plugins`
2. Select `alberto-skills`
3. Choose the skills to install
4. Restart Claude Code

## Adding Skills to This Marketplace

### Method 1: Add to Marketplace (Recommended)

1. Add your skill directory to `plugins/`
2. Edit `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` and add a new entry:

```json
{
  "name": "your-skill-name",
  "source": "./plugins/your-skill-name",
  "description": "Brief description of what the skill does",
  "strict": false,
  "skills": ["./"]
}
```

**Important:** The `skills` field is required to load skills from the marketplace. It tells Claude Code which directories contain SKILL.md files.

3. Update the CHANGELOG.md
4. Commit your changes

### Method 2: Direct Installation

Skills can also be installed directly without using the marketplace:

```bash
# Personal (available everywhere)
cp -r plugins/your-skill ~/.claude/skills/

# Project (shared with team)
cp -r plugins/your-skill .claude/skills/
```
